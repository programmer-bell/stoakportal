### 📈 Stock Portal (Project-Based Learning) ###

This repository represents a project-based learning exercise focused on building a simple Stock Portal application using:

React (Frontend)

Django + Django REST Framework (Backend API)

The aim of this project is not production readiness, but learning by building—understanding concepts through trial, error, and hands-on experimentation.

🚀 Overview

The Stock Portal is a dummy application created to explore:

How to structure a React frontend

How to build RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework

How frontend and backend communicate

How to integrate APIs in a real application flow

There are no advanced features or optimizations; the focus is on foundational learning, experimenting, and making mistakes to understand the full development process.

🎯 Key Learning Objectives
✔️ Project-Based Learning

Learn by implementing a real mini-project.

Understand end-to-end workflow from design to deployment.

Practice debugging, structuring code, and fixing mistakes.

✔️ Backend Development (Django + DRF)

Creating API endpoints

Serializers, views, and models

Basic CRUD operations for stock data

Connecting to the frontend via REST APIs

✔️ Frontend Development (React)

Components, props, state management

Fetching data from the backend

Rendering stock data dynamically

Handling async API calls and UI updates

✔️ Full-Stack Integration

Configuring CORS

Connecting React with Django REST API

Understanding request-response cycles

Working with JSON data between client and server

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React

Axios / Fetch API

JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend

Python

Django

📚 Purpose of the Project

This project is meant purely for learning and experimentation:

No filters

No production-grade architecture

No complex business logic

Just pure practice to understand how a real-world full-stack application fits together.

📦 Features (Basic)

Dummy stock list display

API-driven data fetching

Simple UI for viewing stock information

Modular backend structure for easy learning

🚧 Disclaimer

This project is not intended for production.
It is a learning-only exercise meant to help understand fundamental full-stack concepts through progressive development and hands-on practice.
